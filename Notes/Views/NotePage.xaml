<!-- By default, the Grid control contains a single row and column, 
    creating a single cell. Columns are defined with a width, and 
    the * value for width tells the column to fill up as much space 
    as possible. 
    
    
    Setting the binding context directly in the XAML provides two things:

    At run time, when the page is navigated to, it displays a blank note. 
    This is because the parameterless constructor for the binding context, 
    the viewmodel, is invoked. If you remember correctly, the parameterless 
    constructor for the Note viewmodel creates a blank note.

    The intellisense in the XAML editor shows the available properties as 
    soon as you start typing {Binding syntax. The syntax is also validated 
    and alerts you of an invalid value. Try changing the binding syntax for 
    the SaveCommand to Save123Command. If you hover the mouse cursor over 
    the text, you'll notice that a tooltip is displayed informing you that 
    Save123Command isn't found. This notification isn't considered an error 
    because bindings are dynamic, it's really a small warning that might 
    help you notice when you typed the wrong property.-->
